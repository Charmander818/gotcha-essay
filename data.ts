    questionText: "Assess whether all market economies should become mixed economies.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• NO: Explanations of why market economies should remain as they are e.g., because there is no (or minimal) government intervention, decisions are taken on the basis of demand and supply, competition is encouraged and so production is more efficient, and consumers and producers act on their own self-interest. 
• YES: Explanations of why market economies should become mixed economies e.g., because in a market economy there is non-provision of public goods, the under-consumption of merit goods, the over-consumption of demerit goods and the existence of markets where prices are too low, too high, or too unstable.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation of whether all market economies should become mixed economies leading to a justified conclusion.
Points to consider may include whether governments should provide public goods, merit goods, reduce the provision of demerit goods, intervene in the price mechanism etc.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment. 
• The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. 
Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:
• The degree to which the potential benefits of economic growth are equally shared among a population. 
• The extent to which any shift towards more capital- intensive production affects the level of unemployment
• Whether long-term economic growth brings about a short-term cost as resources are used to produce capital goods rather than consumer goods

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
An analysis of the potential advantages of an appreciation, such as a reduction in the prices of imports, both of finished goods and of raw materials and component parts, reducing inflationary pressures in an economy. An analysis of the potential disadvantages of an appreciation, such as an increase in the price of exports making them less competitive. 
Note: maximum mark of 2 if only advantages or disadvantages discussed.

    maxMarks: 12,
    questionText: "Assess whether supply-side policies are the most effective way to correct a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Successful supply-side policies will cause a rightward shift in the long-run AS curve, reflecting more efficient production. This would make a country’s products more competitive in international markets and so there is likely to be an increase in net exports, correcting a deficit in the current account. 
Supply-side policies could include improvements in training and education, making labour markets more flexible, reductions in the powers of trade unions, an increase in competition and a reduction in rules and regulations.
Potential disadvantages of supply-side policies are that they are essentially a long-run solution and so may take a relatively long period of time to have an impact, such as improvements in training and education. Some of the policies could be quite expensive and so would involve the government in considerable expenditure, money which could have spent elsewhere (giving rise to the issue of opportunity cost).
Guidance: There are a number of alternative approaches to answering this question. At the simplest level, analysis and evaluation may focus on an assessment of the effectiveness of supply side policies only. Furthermore, this may be expanded to include a direct comparison with the effectiveness of alternative policies such as fiscal, monetary or protectionist policies. In addition, such an assessment may simply be part of evaluation. However, if supply side policies are ignored or receive scant attention then only a Level 2 mark may be awarded.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:
the cause of the deficit, the cost and ease of introducing various policies, the possible unintended consequences of introducing policies etc. leading to a justified conclusion as to whether supply-side policies would be the most effective way to correct a deficit in the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.`

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding (3 marks maximum)
An understanding of a PPC shown through an accurate diagram, with correctly labelled axes (1), a movement along a PPC showing a trade-off between production on the two axes (1), and a shift of a PPC showing an increase in production of two goods with no trade-off. (1)

AO2 Analysis (3 marks maximum)
Uses the PPC to explain that a movement along a PPC is caused by a reallocation of resources (1), as resources are shifted between the two types of product, involving an opportunity cost (1), but a shift of a PPC is caused by an increase in the quantity and/or quality of resources, allowing more of both goods to be produced.

    maxMarks: 12,
    questionText: "Assess whether education should be classified as a public good rather than classified as a merit good.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• Education is classified as a merit good because it is a private good with the characteristics of being both rival and excludable; it can therefore be provided through a market because it is possible to charge a price for it, although it can also be provided by the state.
• A public good is distinct from a private good because it has the characteristics of being both non-rival and non-excludable; it is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to charge a price for it due to the existence of the free rider problem; it therefore has to be provided by the state. 

AO3 Evaluation
• Public goods can only be provided by the state.
• Merit goods will be underprovided in the free market and governments should intervene to increase provision.
• However, if the demand for education is extremely low in a country, when provided through a market, a government could decide to provide it entirely through the state.
• In conclusion, education should be classified as a merit good rather than as a public good.`

• Food vouchers etc.
The advantages and disadvantages include:
• They can be targeted at those most in need.
• They can be targeted at the purchase of basic foodstuffs BUT
• May be costly and have an opportunity cost.

The equilibrium point is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied (1) and there is no tendency to change in a market (1) with an accurately labelled diagram showing the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity (1)

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Note: there are two possible approaches to answering this question. If both the approach focused on demand-side (inferior and normal goods) and the supply-side approach are attempted, then only the best response should be marked including marks for evaluation.
EITHER: The demand curve will be expected to shift in this situation. Whether it shifts to the left or to the right will depend on the nature of the product and will shift to the left if it is an inferior good or to the right if it is a normal good. This should be the basis of the discussion. For an accurately labelled diagram demonstrating at least one of the appropriate shift(s) in the demand curve i.e., to the right and / or the left (1) that clearly shows the change in the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity for both a normal and inferior good (1) and is accompanied by a clear explanation of both shifts (1).
OR: The supply curve will be expected to shift to the left in this situation. For a fully accurately labelled diagram that is clearly micro based and focused on the impact on a single product (1) that is used to clearly explain the resulting change in the price depending on whether demand is price elastic or price inelastic) (1) and quantity supplied (depending on whether supply is price elastic or price inelastic/use of buffer stocks/ effect of improved productivity) (1)

    questionText: "Entrepreneurs are vital in a modern economy to achieve long run economic growth. Assess whether encouraging entrepreneurship or increasing another of the factors of production will be a more effective way to achieve long run economic growth.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)
The advantages of encouraging entrepreneurship include:
• The fact that entrepreneurs are the ones who organise the other three factors of production to produce output in an economy.
• They are the ones who take risks and in return receive profit which is the motivation to be successful and so stimulate economic growth.
• The fact that entrepreneurs must be creative and innovative to succeed and therefore should have the skills to anticipate current and future needs to be successful and therefore increase the productive potential of an economy and thus stimulate long run economic growth e.g., as measured by a shift to the right of the PPC.
• Modern economies are dynamic, ever changing and the need to respond quickly to changes is one that can be met by successful entrepreneurs.
BUT
• There may be a cost in training and educating future entrepreneurs.
• The rate of success of a policy to increase entrepreneurship may be low
• The success depends on other factors such as the availability of government subsidies etc. which have an opportunity cost as well as the availability and quality of the other factors of production,
• Because of high risks, entrepreneurs may seek short run gain which may not encourage long run economic growth and may in fact make it less likely e.g., due to rapid depletion of scarce resources.
These should be compared with the likely importance and the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of increasing one other factor of production i.e., land OR labour OR capital. This may include an assessment of the availability of other factors of production.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation (max 4 marks)
• Consideration of the likely importance of increasing entrepreneurship compared to increasing one other factor of production to increase long run economic growth in a modern economy.
• In conclusion, which factor of production is likely to be the most important.`

Explain the difference between the principles of absolute advantage and comparative advantage and consider whether the principle of comparative advantage is always the more important influence when each country is deciding whether to trade with each other.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)
Absolute advantage is a situation where, for a given set of resources, one country can produce more of a certain product than another country (1) comparative advantage exists where one country can produce a certain product at a lower opportunity cost than another country (1) plus a simple explanation that one country may have an absolute advantage in both products but the other country may have a lower opportunity cost in producing one of the products (1)

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
The analysis should consider the advantages and disadvantages of using the principle of comparative advantage in deciding whether to trade or not.
Maximum of 2 marks for an analysis that only considers the advantages and a maximum of 2 marks for an analysis that only considers the disadvantages.
Points to consider include (N.B. this list is not exhaustive so allow any reasoned points):
• The benefits of specialisation leading to a more efficient allocation of resources
• An increase in world output
• An increase in employment and living standards BUT
• May exhaust finite natural resources due to over specialisation.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)
Cost push inflation is inflation caused by increases in the costs of production (1). Demand pull inflation is caused by increases in AD not matched by equivalent increases in AS (1). A clear explanation of the differences between the two (1)

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
A depreciation in the exchange rate will lead to a fall in the price of exports for the trading partner and a rise in the price of imports for the country in question. This should be analysed with reference to the impact on the different types of inflation.
Maximum of 2 marks if only demand-pull inflation is considered and should focus on the impact of the fall in price of exports and the rise in the price of imports and the possible impact on the X -M component of AD and therefore the impact on AD overall. Reference may be made to the PED of exports and the PED of imports.
Maximum of 2 marks if only cost push inflation is considered. Reference must be made to the importance of imports (1) and the fact that this country has few natural resources which probably means they must be imported for the 2nd mark.

• The use of interest rates to dampen AD.
• Reductions in money supply to dampen AD.
• The use of credit regulations to influence bank lending BUT
• There is also a time lag between implementing interest rate policy and it taking effect.
• Other factors other than interest rates may affect consumer spending and offset the impact of a rise in interest rates e.g., consumer confidence, expectations etc.

    questionText: "Assess whether the concept of price elasticity of supply or cross elasticity of demand will be the more useful to a business wanting to increase its total sales in a growing economy.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Analysis of the concept of price elasticity of supply may explain its use in increasing a business’ total sales by examining the following.
• Usefulness depends on the type of goods and whether decisions need to be made in the short run or long run.
• It may help businesses with regards to stock holding and decisions about which products to focus on
• It may help businesses make decisions about productive capacity and whether e.g., to invest in new technology BUT
• It depends on the accuracy of the data used to produce the value.
• This may change over time and the value may have little value in a growing economy.
• Some products, such as agricultural/perishable products, will naturally have a more price inelastic supply and knowledge of the value may have little use.
Analysis of the concept of cross elasticity of demand may explain its use in increasing a business’s total revenue by examining the following.
• It will mean the business understands the relationship between its product and others i.e., whether they are complements or substitutes.
• It also measures the closeness of the relationship and informs decisions about how quickly and the extent to which it should react for example if a competitor changes its prices.
• It should assist a business to develop a pricing strategy that maximises opportunities to generate more sales BUT
• The usefulness depends on the accuracy of the data and in a growing economy, it may not be possible to keep the value up to date. It is therefore often dependent on estimates that may be inaccurate.
• Businesses may not be able to act on the data by changing prices if their cost structure cannot be easily changed.
• Other variables other than cross elasticity of demand may be more important for example non price determinants such as brand loyalty.
Better answers will refer directly/implicitly to their usefulness to a business operating in a growing economy. Answers which do not are unlikely to gain more than L3 lower band.
One sided response i.e., those that only consider one concept or do not analyse the problems of at least one concept will not gain beyond L2.

AO3 Evaluation
• Consideration of the likely effectiveness of both measures in increasing total sales in a growing economy that assesses which is most likely to be effective. If there is no direct/implicit reference to a growing economy, then L1 upper maximum.
• Candidates may consider an alternative concept e.g., YED to assess whether sales would actually grow in these circumstances,

AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider include.
• Merit goods and demerit goods need government intervention because of the issues of under and over consumption due to imperfect information, so the market economy fails to operate efficiently.
• Other types of private good can be efficiently provided by the market economy without government intervention but the process of allocation may mean e.g., low-income groups do not have the same access to certain goods.

Better answers will examine the impacts on the wider economy i.e., employment, price stability, economic growth as well the on the current account. Reference will also be made to the dependency on international trade.
For a rise in the terms of trade:
• This may lower inflation if raw material import prices are lower.
• Depending on price elasticity of demand, it may lead to economic growth if the income earned from exports increases and a boost to employment.
• It may however lead to lower economic growth if it leads to a current account deficit.
For a fall in the terms of trade:
• Exports may be boosted, and this may lead to higher economic growth.
• It may reduce a current account deficit.
• It may however be a sign of a weak economy with exports that are less in demand and therefore lead to lower economic growth.
• If imports are price inelastic, this may lead to import cost-push inflation if the economy is highly dependent on imported goods.
• Answers which do not refer to the heavy dependence on international trade cannot gain more than L2.
• Answers which only refer to a rise or a fall in the terms of trade cannot gain more than L2.
• At least one negative effect in addition to positive effects (either for a rise or a fall in the terms of trade) should be considered within the analysis to gain lower L3.

The internal effects of inflation are those which affect the domestic economy directly and may include:
• Income redistribution
• Menu costs (or the costs to firms of having to change their prices frequently)
• Shoe leather costs (or the inconvenience of having to hold smaller quantities of cash/searching for the best rate of interest)
• Uncertainty in transactions
• But also, may provide a stimulus for output and be a sign of economic growth.
The external effects of inflation are those which affect its international trade and may include.
• Declining price competitiveness of exports and increased competitiveness for imports
• This may increase the current account deficit.
• May lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate.
• Uncertainty in international transactions
• But also, depending on price elasticity of demand, it may boost revenue from exports plus it will improve the terms of trade and may be a sign of increased demand for its goods and further stimulate output.
• Both internal and external effects need to be considered to gain more than L2.

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
• For example, the vaccine is free at the point of use to the consumer (1). However, there is a cost to the taxpayer (1). This means that there is an opportunity cost to the government as providing the vaccine involves the use of scarce resources (1).
Alternative approach:
• If governments provide free-of-charge vaccinations, then there is no price charged to the consumer (1). This means consumers do not need to use their own their own scarce resources to be vaccinated (1) which means there is no opportunity cost to them because they do not need to make a choice between ‘consuming’ the vaccine and reducing their consumption of other goods and services (1).

Potential benefits of providing healthcare services free-of-charge at the point of use include:
• It addresses concerns on affordability/inequality to access health care, insurance and information gaps e.g. preventative earlier treatments for elderly and children.
• It may also avoid a potential loss of output resulting from worker absenteeism. It increases the likelihood of resources being prioritised to patient need as opposed to profit.
Potential disadvantages from providing healthcare services free-of-charge at the point of use include:
• Demand may exceed supply which may result in increased costs to governments.
• Charging consumers will reduce on wastage in terms of ‘missed’ medical appointments; potential for health inequality resulting in income inequality.
• Private firms may be more efficient in providing the healthcare services required in the quantities and regions required. The opportunity cost to the government in terms of reduced spending on roads etc.

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Candidates may analyse the impact on the demand for one good as a result of whether they are substitutes or complements of other goods (of any valid relationships between goods):
This will include an analysis of the impact on demand for one good because of e.g.:
• Price changes and the availability of complements (a negative value indicates a complement) e.g. a rise in the price of the complement would be expected to reduce the demand for the ‘other good’.
• Price changes and the availability of substitutes (a positive value indicates a substitute) e.g. a rise in the price of the substitute would be expected to increase the demand for the ‘other good’.
• For example, an increase in the price of a complement good is likely to reduce the demand of the good (1) due to the nature of the joint demand between both goods (1). 
• For example, a rise in the price of a substitute good is likely to increase the demand for the other good (1) if the consumer now sees the other good as a direct replacement (1).
• Note: Diagrams are not essential. 
Note: Maximum of 2 marks if only one relationship is analysed. References to changes in income/fashion/tastes/attitudes must not be rewarded.

The measure may be less useful in terms of pricing decisions and may be based on historical data which may be inaccurate.
• Advantages and disadvantages of using price elasticity of demand include the opportunity to measure the impact of price changes but again suffer from the use of historical data which may be inappropriate in a time of economic growth and rising incomes which could affect PED values.
Accept any valid analysis that relates to the use of these measures during a period of economic growth and their impact on the aim of increasing sales revenue.

The question refers to methods of measurement and not types of unemployment. Answers focused on types and not measures cannot answer the question without any reference to methods of measurement and must not be rewarded.
For the identification of 2 methods of measuring unemployment (1) plus for a brief explanation of both measures 2x(1).
Guidance for explanation marks:
The two most used measures are the claimant count measure which is a measure based on those claiming benefits (1) and the labour force measure which is a measure of unemployment based on a survey that identifies people who are actively seeking a job (1). However, if the meaning of these measures is clearly understood then they do not need to explicitly refer to the terms.

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
• The difficulties in obtaining an accurate measurement using both methods should be considered. e.g., the claimant count figure may omit people actively looking for a job and may include people who are, in reality, not looking for a job.
• Whereas the labour force measure is based on sampling which may not be entirely accurate due to sampling errors and/or problems associated with data collection in general.
Note: maximum of 2 marks if the difficulties of only one method of measurement are analysed.

• The discussion should focus on the strengths and weaknesses of supply side policy to solve both cyclical/demand-deficient and structural unemployment. 
• For example, supply side policies may be used to encourage investment into education and training and infrastructure to solve structural problems in the economy and hence structural unemployment.
• However, supply side policies may be less successful in solving cyclical/demand deficient unemployment as they have less impact on the level of aggregate demand (AD) – unless for example, if they involve a direct injection of government spending due to the additional investment.
• Other disadvantages include the potential cost of the policy and the time taken for the policy to be effective.
• Although not necessary, other demand side policies, e.g., fiscal and monetary policies, may be analysed to explain the possible disadvantages of supply side policy. This is an acceptable approach.

• The strengths of a balanced budget may include stability and may encourage both domestic and inward investment, but it may not be sufficiently flexible to deal with changing economic conditions e.g., unemployment and inflation.
• A budget deficit may enable, e.g., economic growth or reduce unemployment but may be unsustainable in the long run.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Potential benefits of an increasing rate of inflation include:
• It stimulates output – a low and stable inflation rate caused by existing demand may make firms feel more optimistic about the future and encourage them to invest to expand their business. 
• A possible reduction in the burden of debt. If inflation is rising faster than the nominal rate of interest on previous borrowing then real interest rates become negative which may stimulate consumer expenditure which, in turn, could lead to higher output and employment. 
Potential costs of an increasing rate of inflation include:
• A reduction in net exports as rising inflation rates may reduce the international competitiveness of a country resulting in reduced export revenue and increased import expenditure.
• Fiscal drag – if tax rates are not increased in line with inflation, then people are ‘dragged’ (pulled) into higher tax brackets. As such, lower proportions of any increase in incomes are enjoyed by the taxpayer.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Protectionism:
• Advantages of protectionism – for example, tariffs can reduce the value of imports in the short term as infant industries grow and gain the economies of scale to enable them to be internationally price competitive. This reduction in foreign dependency will reduce the value of imports which (ceteris paribus) reduce a deficit on the current account.
• Problems of protectionism includes – the ability to reduce the value of imports will be influenced by the price elasticity of demand for imports. Moreover, the possibility of retaliation thereby reducing the value of exports. This may not only limit any reduction in the current account deficit but may hinder a government’s ability to achieve other macroeconomic objectives – e.g., reducing the level of unemployment or possibility of increasing cost-push inflation.
• Alternative policies that may be considered include contractionary monetary policy – higher interest rates will increase the cost of debt and mortgage repayments and leave people with less money to spend. Therefore, this will reduce their consumption of imports, improving the current account. 
• Problems of the alternative policy – for example, an increase in interest rates will tend to cause hot money flows and therefore an appreciation in the exchange rate. This appreciation makes exports less competitive, and imports more attractive. Assuming demand is relatively elastic, this appreciation will worsen the current account.

AO3 Evaluation
• Requires an assessment of the protectionism and at least one other policy in reducing a current account deficit which leads to 
• A justified conclusion as to which policy may be best way to reduce economic growth or whether a combination of policies might be more appropriate.`

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
An analysis of the reasons for a movement within a PPC and a shift of a PPC:
• Movement within a PPC is caused by a reallocation of existing resources. (1)
• A shift of a PPC is the result of an increase in the quantity and/or quality of resources or the impact of an improvement in technology. (1)
• A shift of a PPC does not involve the concept of opportunity cost because with the use of additional resources, more of two goods could be produced. (1)

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
An analysis of the impact of a subsidy in a market:
• A subsidy is a sum of money paid by a government to a producer. (1)
• The effect of an increase in a subsidy is that the price charged to a consumer will be lower than it would otherwise have been, leading to an increase in quantity; this may be done to keep down the price, and encourage the consumption, of certain products. (1)
• The effect of a decrease in a subsidy would have the opposite effect. (1)

Explanation of the potential disadvantages and limitations of an increase in the tax on a demerit good:
• The demand for the demerit good may be relatively inelastic meaning that the increase in tax will only have a relatively slight impact.
• Other methods may be more effective in decreasing consumption, such as an information campaign to make consumers more aware of the potential disadvantages of consuming a demerit good or the establishment of a minimum price for a demerit good.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Analysis should focus on the extent to which this is beneficial to consumers and providers. For example charging a fee:
• Discourages unnecessary or excessive use of healthcare services, helping to prevent resource wastage and long waiting times.
• Generates funds that can be reinvested into improving healthcare quality and infrastructure, benefiting both consumers and providers in the long term
• Reduces the financial strain on government budgets, allowing funds to be allocated to other public services or targeted subsidies for those in genuine need
Considering the problems, for example charging fees:
• Increase inequality in access as charging fees is likely to disproportionately affect low-income individuals
• Some individuals may avoid seeking care due to cost, even when treatment is essential, which could lead to worsened health outcomes and higher long-term healthcare costs

Guidance:
The effect depends on the government policy used however it must be targeted at a particular market. Government microeconomic policy may include indirect taxes, subsidies, maximum and minimum prices, direct provision, regulations, provision of information and buffer stock schemes. Candidates should analyse at least one of these policies to consider the extent to which it may shift the supply curve for a particular market to the right.
For example, the government may intervene by providing subsidies to education providers (1) which may increase the supply of education to the market and shift the supply curve to the right (1) however, the extent to which this will occur will depend on e.g., the size of the subsidy.

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)

Potential benefits of increasing economic growth. For example:
• Economic growth often leads to increased real GDP per capita, allowing consumers to enjoy more goods and services and improve their quality of life.

Potential costs of increasing economic growth include:
• Economic growth can disproportionately benefit the wealthy, leading to a widening gap between rich and poor, with some groups not experiencing the same level of improvement.
• Increased production and consumption associated with growth can lead to higher pollution levels, depletion of natural resources, and other environmental harm.

AO3 Evaluation
Requires an assessment of the benefits and costs of increased economic growth (which may refer to specific groups) which leads to a justified conclusion as to whether or not economic growth is always beneficial`

• Higher exports prices allow the country to receive a higher income from selling the same quantity of goods and services abroad. This increase in export revenue improves the current account balance (1).
• When the cost of importing goods decreases, the country can now import the same quantity of goods at a lower price, resulting in lower import expenditure and an improvement in the current account balance (1).

nearer the value is to zero income is more equally distributed and/or the 
nearer the value is to one the more it is unequally distributed (1).

Reasons may include: 
 A lack of employment opportunities e.g., which will mean that income 
levels are low (1) which may be more of a problem in low-income 
countries because industry may be less well developed (1). 
 Poor vocational training e.g., leading to fewer people being able to 
develop their skills and earn a higher income (1). This may be more of a 
problem in such countries because of the lack of finance to provide such 
training. (1) 
 A lack of investment in education and health e.g., meaning that some 
people may not receive a better level of education or may suffer long term 
health issues which will lower their potential income levels. (1) This may 
be more common in such countries due to a lack of government budget

Policies may include: 
 Minimum wage rates 
 Transfer payments 
 Progressive income taxes 
 State provision of essential goods and services 
 Investment in infrastructure 
Accept any valid policies but the analysis must focus on how they may be 
used to redistribute income and wealth and their advantages and 
disadvantages to be credited. 
E.g., A minimum wage rate that is set above the equilibrium, should increase 
the income levels of those on the lowest levels and therefore possibly ensure 
that poverty is reduced. However, if everyone’s income levels increased, this 
will not have a redistribution effect. It will not impact on the self-employed. It 
may lead to unemployment and more poverty leading to less redistribution if 
businesses cannot afford the higher rates. 
E.g., Progressive income taxes should ensure that those on lower incomes 
pay less tax as a percentage of income than those on higher incomes. This 
should have a redistributive effect. However, those on higher incomes may 
have the ability to reduce their tax burden or may simply leave the country. It 
may also reduce incentives to earn more.

    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks) 
Protectionism is when governments attempt to protect domestic businesses 
against foreign competition (1). It seeks to reduce the impact of the free 
market/ restrict free trade (1) by increasing the price competitiveness of 
domestic businesses against foreign competitors (1). 
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks) 
 An explanation of how tariffs work (diagram will help although this is not 
essential) as a method of protectionism i.e., increasing prices of imports 
and increasing the price competitiveness of domestic businesses. NB: no 
marks for a diagram unless it is used to explain the impact on the price of 
imports and how it protects domestic businesses. Up to 2 marks e.g., for 
an explanation of how tariffs increase the price of imports (1) and how 
this protects domestic businesses as it increases their price 
competitiveness (1)
 Problems may include possible retaliation, inelastic PED for imports, 
possible cost push inflationary pressure. Up to 2 marks e.g., retaliation 
by other countries may offset the impact, if the demand for imports is 
price inelastic then imports may not fall and domestic businesses will not 
benefit, if the impact is on imported raw materials, this will lead to cost 
push inflation and domestic businesses who rely on such imports will not 
benefit. 
 If only uses or problems of tariffs are discussed, maximum mark of 
2. 
AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks) 
 Evaluation should consider how effective tariffs may be considering both 
how they can protect domestic businesses and the associated problems 
with 1 mark reserved for a justified conclusion.`

 Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of free trade and
 Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of protectionism 
 Both in the context of a developing economy. 
Guidance: 
The advantages of free trade may include: 
 Efficient allocation of resources due to specialisation and comparative 
advantage. 
 An opportunity to take advantage of different factor endowments. 
 Competitive pressure to keep costs down / increase efficiency / lower 
prices for consumers. 
 Higher output / economies of scale and increased choice and availability 
for consumers. 
 Disadvantages may include: 
 Over exploitation of scarce resources. 
 Closure of domestic industries and /or problems for developing industries 
leading to unemployment particularly in a developing economy. 
 Dumping / unfair competition. 
 It is likely that the advantages of protectionism will result from the 
disadvantages of free trade and the disadvantages of protectionism will 
result from the advantages of free trade.

An accurate PPC diagram – a concave or straight-line curve that meets both 
axes with appropriate and correctly labelled axes (1); explanation of scarcity 
and / or opportunity cost (1) and how the scarcity in factor 
endowments/scarce results and infinite wants results in choices having to be 
made (1).
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
If the candidates uses a straight line PPC
Uses the diagram to explain that scarcity is shown as a point on the straight 
line PPC (1); the opportunity cost of changing production combinations is 
shown as a movement along the PPC (1), the opportunity cost is equal due to 
the negative one gradient of the PPC (accept constant trade off although not 
strictly true) (1)
If the candidates uses a concave PPC
Uses the diagram to explain that scarcity is shown as a point on the concave 
PPC (1); the opportunity cost of changing production combinations is shown 
as a movement along the PPC (1), the opportunity cost is not equal due to the 
increased trade-off the greater the proportion of resources allocated to the 
production of a good (1)
AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)
One mark for a valid explanation that the extent to which each choice has an 
equal opportunity cost depends on the shape of the PPC (1) or whether or not 
there are unused factors of production when the choice is being made (1).

economy e.g., in terms of employment levels, economic growth, inflation, 
living standards, government budget, business confidence, possible need 
to restructure the economy etc.
• Analysis of the consequences of a persistent deficit on the external 
economy e.g., exchange rates, ability to trade, need for imports, debt 
interest, etc.
Note: accept answers that refer to the impact on other economies when 
another economy has a persistent current account deficit.
Max L 2 if only the consequences on the domestic or the external economy 
are considered.
AO3 Evaluation
That clearly considers the likely consequences on both parts of the economy 
and comes to a conclusion as to the most likely consequences.
Accept all valid responses.
A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.`

    questionText: "Explain two economic reasons for inequality in the distribution of \nincome and wealth and consider why inequality in the distribution of \nwealth cannot easily be measured.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding (max 3 marks)
• An explanation of how inequality of income and wealth means an uneven 
distribution of income and wealth among a population (1).
• An explanation of two reasons for income and wealth inequality.
– For example: Poor education and training results in the individual 
gaining fewer/less marketable skills that prevents them from applying 
for jobs with higher salaries (1).
– Low rates of saving which makes it increasingly difficult to buy 
property. Wealth inequality widens as rising property prices not only 
make it more difficult to purchase a property, but benefits those who 
are already property owners (1).
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Points to consider may include (other difficulties may be considered):
• Wealth is comprised from many sources housing assets, savings, 
financial instruments, pensions, and different countries have different 
ways of measuring it (1). 
• Some wealth may not be included in any calculation should wealthy 
individuals legally use tax havens to reduce the value of their wealth (1). 
• Ownership of wealth may be transferred to family members to reduce the 
value of personal wealth value (1).
AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)
• For a balanced evaluation of whether wealth inequality cannot always 
easily be measured (1), leading to a justified conclusion (1).`

    questionText: "Assess which policies are likely to be most effective in redistributing \nincome.",
    markScheme: `AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Polices may include:
• Use of policies to redistribute income. For example, the introduction of a 
minimum wage (or increase an existing minimum wage) will increase the 
wage of the lowest earners and reduce the difference between the 
highest and lowest earners.
• Problems of minimum wages include the possibility of increasing costpush inflation, higher rates of unemployment and that in some countries 
only a small proportion of the population are in receipt of the minimum 
wage.
• Alternative policies that may be considered include progressive tax 
systems – by increasing the number of tax brackets or increasing the 
higher tax rates will reduce the post-tax income of higher earners and 
reduce the difference between the highest and lowest earners. 
• Problems of the alternative policy – for example, increased incentives for 
individuals to seek ways to legally avoid the higher tax rates. Increased 
administrative costs associated with implementing new systems for 
income assessment and tax collection.
Level 1 responses will be assertive and lacking in explanations / mainly 
descriptive and/or or mainly lacking in relevance to the question.
Level 2 responses may contain some inaccuracies and may be one sided. 
Analysis will be explained at least in part and will be largely relevant to the 
question.
Level 3 responses will consider alternative policies / concepts etc. and will 
be balanced. Explanations of points raised will be offered and will be accurate 
and relevant to the question.
AO3 Evaluation
• Requires an assessment of at least two policies to be compared against 
each other which leads to
• A justified conclusion as to which policy (or combination) is most likely to 
be most effective in redistributing income.
Accept all valid responses.
Note: A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.`
